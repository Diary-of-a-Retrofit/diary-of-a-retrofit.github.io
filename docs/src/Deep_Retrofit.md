# Deep Retrofit

[Passivhaus](https://www.passivhaustrust.org.uk/competitions_and_campaigns/passivhaus-retrofit/) 
have a pretty convincing pitch on why deeper retrofits are a 
moral imperative.  

For example, with only x number of years to hit
Net-Zero, we have insufficient time and resources to 
achieve these goals with 20-year cycles of shallow 
retrofits.

I found the concept of sterilisation particularly
salient.  By investing time and capital in a given 
space we are thereafter reluctant to revisit for greater 
thermal performance in it until the non-insulating 
materials are showing signs of ware.

Therefore, counter to some intuition I am going to 
choose to go deep on the least comfortable rooms I have 
first and work my way around the house as money allows.  
This will mean I dedicate more resources to Thermal 
bridging than building Codes may require as I hope for 
them to be the final word or leave room for planned,
non-destructive remediation at a later date.

At this stage I am not commited to finishing to any 
relevant standard EACB, EnerPHit or EnerPHit Component 
method.  Although I will lend from the Step-By-Step 
approach leaving myself to later buy in.  This may prove 
impossible due to particular constrains of my building 
and its site.  I will investigate the ROI in property 
valuation and running costs before commiting to 
certify the building.

Although it is not obvious in the EnerPhit material, it 
is almost essential to hire an architect to work to 
their programme.  Similarly, local charities in this 
space, may only offer advice on properties with cavity 
walls.  Solid walls are considered complex and so a 
designer needs to be engaged.  This is somewhere in the 
region of 8 million of solid wall homes in the UK, it is 
impractical and cost prohibitive to hire architectural 
services for all of these homes.  We need to be sharing 
professional grade details much more generously if we 
are to achieve a fraction of the retrofits we need to.
