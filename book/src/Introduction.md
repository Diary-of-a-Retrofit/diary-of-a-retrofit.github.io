# Introduction

I decided that I wanted to start insulating my 
Edwardian/Victorian Era solid stone wall house.

I had resisted doing this previously as doing it wrong 
can be dangerous.  However, with intelligent membranes, 
careful details and good material choices it should be 
possible to drastically reduce the energy cost of 
keeping this quite typical building comfortable.

As I ended up lost in a number of rabbit holes in my 
research, I decided to document my process.  This is for 
my own benefit, keeping organised and also encase it 
might inform someone else embarking on a similar scheme.
